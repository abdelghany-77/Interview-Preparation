        q: "What is SQL?",
        a: "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. We use SQL to perform operations like querying data, inserting records, updating existing data, deleting records, and creating database structures like tables and views. It's the backbone of database communication in applications.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a database?",
        a: "A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. It's designed to efficiently store, organize, retrieve, and manage large amounts of information. Databases allow multiple users to access data simultaneously while maintaining data integrity and security through ACID properties and access controls.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a primary key?",
        a: "A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It has two important characteristics: it must contain unique values (no duplicates) and it cannot contain NULL values. The primary key enforces entity integrity, ensuring that each record in the table can be uniquely identified. For example, in a Users table, 'user_id' would typically be the primary key.",
        example: `CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100),
  name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Composite Primary Key
CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a foreign key?",
        a: "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes and enforces a link between the data in two tables, ensuring referential integrity. This means you can't have a value in the foreign key column that doesn't exist in the referenced primary key column. Foreign keys are essential for maintaining relationships in relational databases.",
        example: `CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?",
        a: "While both ensure uniqueness, they have key differences: A primary key uniquely identifies each record and cannot be NULL - a table can have only ONE primary key. A unique key also ensures uniqueness but CAN accept NULL values (usually one NULL), and a table can have MULTIPLE unique keys. Primary keys are used for identification, while unique keys are used to prevent duplicate values in specific columns like email addresses or phone numbers.",
        example: `CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Only one primary key
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,      -- Can have multiple unique keys
  phone VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE,       -- Another unique key
  ssn VARCHAR(11) UNIQUE          -- Can accept one NULL value
);`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is normalization?",
        a: "Normalization is the systematic process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing larger tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between them. The goal is to eliminate data duplication, ensure data dependencies make sense, and make the database more flexible and maintainable. This process follows specific normal forms, each with its own rules.",
        example: `-- Before Normalization (Redundant data)
Orders: order_id, customer_name, customer_email, product_name, price

-- After Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
Customers: customer_id, customer_name, customer_email
Products: product_id, product_name, price
Orders: order_id, customer_id, product_id`,
      },
      {
        q: "What are the different types of normalization?",
        a: "Normalization follows progressive normal forms: \n• First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate repeating groups, ensure atomic values \n• Second Normal Form (2NF): Remove partial dependencies on composite keys \n• Third Normal Form (3NF): Remove transitive dependencies \n• Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A stricter version of 3NF \n• Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Remove multi-valued dependencies \n• Fifth Normal Form (5NF/PJNF): Remove join dependencies. \n\nMost applications typically normalize up to 3NF, which provides a good balance between data integrity and query performance.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is a join in SQL?",
        a: "A JOIN is an SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It's fundamental for retrieving data from multiple tables in a single query. The main types are INNER JOIN (returns matching rows), LEFT JOIN (all rows from left table plus matches), RIGHT JOIN (all rows from right table plus matches), and FULL OUTER JOIN (all rows from both tables).",
        example: `-- INNER JOIN - only matching records
SELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.name
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN - all from left + matches from right
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_id
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE in SQL?",
        a: "DELETE and TRUNCATE both remove data, but differently: \n\nDELETE: Removes specific rows based on a WHERE condition, can be rolled back (transactional), triggers fire, slower as it logs each row deletion, and identity counters are not reset. \n\nTRUNCATE: Removes ALL rows from a table, cannot be rolled back (DDL operation), triggers don't fire, much faster as it deallocates data pages, and resets identity counters to their seed value. Use TRUNCATE when you need to quickly empty a table and don't need transaction support.",
        example: `-- DELETE - Removes specific rows, can rollback
DELETE FROM Users WHERE last_login < '2020-01-01';

-- TRUNCATE - Removes all rows, cannot rollback, faster
TRUNCATE TABLE TempLogs;

-- DELETE logs each row, TRUNCATE deallocates pages`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?",
        a: "Both combine result sets from multiple SELECT statements vertically, but UNION removes duplicate rows while UNION ALL includes all rows including duplicates. UNION is slower because it performs a DISTINCT operation to eliminate duplicates, whereas UNION ALL is faster as it simply appends all results. Use UNION when you need unique results, and UNION ALL when you know there are no duplicates or duplicates are acceptable.",
        example: `-- UNION - Removes duplicates (slower)
SELECT name FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT name FROM Suppliers;

-- UNION ALL - Keeps all duplicates (faster)
SELECT name FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM Suppliers;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between the HAVING clause and the WHERE clause?",
        a: "WHERE and HAVING both filter data, but at different stages: \n\nWHERE filters individual rows BEFORE grouping occurs. It operates on raw data and cannot use aggregate functions. \n\nHAVING filters grouped results AFTER the GROUP BY clause. It works on aggregated data and CAN use aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG. \n\nThink of it as: WHERE filters rows, HAVING filters groups.",
        example: `-- WHERE - filters before grouping
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as emp_count
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 50000  -- Filter individual rows first
GROUP BY department;

-- HAVING - filters after grouping
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;  -- Filter grouped results

-- Both together
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count
FROM Employees
WHERE status = 'active'      -- Filter rows first
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;         -- Then filter groups`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a transaction in SQL?",
        a: "A transaction is a logical unit of work consisting of one or more SQL operations that are executed as a single unit. Transactions follow the ACID properties to ensure data consistency and integrity. They either complete entirely (COMMIT) or rollback completely if any error occurs (ROLLBACK), ensuring the database never remains in an inconsistent state. Transactions are critical for maintaining data integrity in concurrent environments.",
        example: `-- Transaction example: Transfer money
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts 
SET balance = balance - 100 
WHERE account_id = 1;

UPDATE Accounts 
SET balance = balance + 100 
WHERE account_id = 2;

-- If both succeed
COMMIT;

-- If any fails
ROLLBACK;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?",
        a: "Clustered Index: Determines the physical order of data storage in the table. The table data is sorted and stored based on the clustered index key. A table can have only ONE clustered index, typically on the primary key. Searching is faster as data is physically ordered. \n\nNon-Clustered Index: Creates a separate structure with pointers to the actual data. Doesn't affect physical data order. A table can have MULTIPLE non-clustered indexes. It stores the index key and a pointer to the data row. Useful for frequently searched columns.",
        example: `-- Clustered Index (only one per table)
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_user_id 
ON Users(user_id);

-- Non-Clustered Index (multiple allowed)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_email 
ON Users(email);

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_lastname 
ON Users(last_name);

-- Clustered: Physical order = Index order
-- Non-Clustered: Separate structure with pointers`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is ACID in the context of database transactions?",
        a: "ACID is a set of four properties that guarantee reliable database transaction processing: \n\n• Atomicity: All operations in a transaction succeed or all fail - no partial completion. It's 'all or nothing'. \n\n• Consistency: Transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all defined rules and constraints. \n\n• Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other. Each transaction executes as if it's the only one. \n\n• Durability: Once committed, changes are permanent and survive system failures, crashes, or power outages. \n\nThese properties ensure data reliability and integrity in multi-user database environments.",
        example: `-- Atomicity Example
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE Inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 10;
  INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (101, 10, 1);
COMMIT;  -- Both succeed or both fail

-- Isolation Levels
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- Prevents dirty reads

-- Durability
-- Once COMMIT is executed, data is written to disk
-- and survives system crashes`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a deadlock?",
        a: "A deadlock is a situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks on resources, creating a circular dependency. For example, Transaction A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2, while Transaction B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1. Neither can proceed, causing the system to hang. Database systems typically detect deadlocks and automatically kill one transaction (the 'victim') to break the deadlock, allowing the other to complete.",
        example: `-- Deadlock Scenario
-- Transaction 1:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE TableA SET value = 1 WHERE id = 1;  -- Locks TableA
-- waiting...
UPDATE TableB SET value = 2 WHERE id = 1;  -- Needs lock on TableB
COMMIT;

-- Transaction 2 (running simultaneously):
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE TableB SET value = 3 WHERE id = 1;  -- Locks TableB
-- waiting...
UPDATE TableA SET value = 4 WHERE id = 1;  -- Needs lock on TableA
COMMIT;

-- Deadlock! Both waiting for each other's locks`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a database and a schema?",
        a: "A database is the highest-level container that holds all database objects and represents a complete data storage system. It contains multiple schemas, tables, views, procedures, etc. \n\nA schema is a logical container within a database that organizes and groups related objects like tables, views, and procedures. It acts as a namespace and defines ownership and access boundaries. For example, in MySQL, database and schema are often used interchangeably, but in SQL Server or PostgreSQL, a database can contain multiple schemas like 'sales_schema' and 'hr_schema'.",
        example: `-- In PostgreSQL/SQL Server
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;

CREATE SCHEMA sales;
CREATE SCHEMA hr;

-- Tables in different schemas
CREATE TABLE sales.customers (...);
CREATE TABLE hr.employees (...);

-- In MySQL (database = schema)
CREATE DATABASE sales_db;
USE sales_db;
CREATE TABLE customers (...);`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a temporary table and a table variable?",
        a: "Temporary Table: Created with CREATE TABLE or SELECT INTO, exists for the duration of a session or transaction, stored in tempdb, can have indexes and constraints, supports transactions, and can be explicitly dropped or automatically removed when session ends. Prefixed with # (local) or ## (global). \n\nTable Variable: Declared with DECLARE @tableName TABLE, exists only within the scope of a batch, function, or stored procedure, limited in scope, automatically deallocated, has limited indexing support, and generally faster for small datasets. Used for temporary data manipulation within procedures.",
        example: `-- Temporary Table (SQL Server)
CREATE TABLE #TempOrders (
  order_id INT,
  total DECIMAL(10,2)
);
INSERT INTO #TempOrders VALUES (1, 100.50);
DROP TABLE #TempOrders;  -- Explicit drop

-- Table Variable
DECLARE @OrderVar TABLE (
  order_id INT,
  total DECIMAL(10,2)
);
INSERT INTO @OrderVar VALUES (1, 100.50);
-- Automatically deallocated at end of scope`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause?",
        a: "The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It's primarily used with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to perform calculations on each group of rows. For example, you can group sales by region to calculate total sales per region, or group employees by department to count employees in each department. Each unique value combination in the GROUP BY columns creates one output row.",
        example: `-- Count employees per department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Multiple columns
SELECT department, job_title, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department, job_title;

-- With HAVING to filter groups
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) as total_sold
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 100;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?",
        a: "CHAR is a fixed-length character data type. If you define CHAR(10), it always uses 10 bytes of storage, padding with spaces if the value is shorter. It's faster for fixed-length data but wastes space. \n\nVARCHAR is variable-length. VARCHAR(10) uses only as much storage as needed (plus 1-2 bytes for length). It's more space-efficient but slightly slower due to variable storage. \n\nUse CHAR for fixed-length data like country codes (US, UK), and VARCHAR for variable-length data like names, emails, or descriptions.",
        example: `-- CHAR - Fixed length
CREATE TABLE Codes (
  country_code CHAR(2),      -- Always 2 bytes: 'US', 'UK'
  state_code CHAR(2)         -- Always 2 bytes
);

-- VARCHAR - Variable length
CREATE TABLE Users (
  name VARCHAR(50),          -- Uses actual length + 1-2 bytes
  email VARCHAR(100),        -- More flexible
  description VARCHAR(500)
);

-- Storage comparison
CHAR(10) stores 'Hi' as 'Hi        ' (10 bytes)
VARCHAR(10) stores 'Hi' as 'Hi' (2 bytes + overhead)`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a stored procedure?",
        a: "A stored procedure is a pre-compiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed repeatedly. It's like a function in programming - you can pass parameters, perform complex operations, and return results. Benefits include code reusability, improved performance (compiled once), better security (users can execute without direct table access), reduced network traffic, and centralized business logic. Stored procedures are essential for complex database operations and maintaining consistent business rules.",
        example: `-- Create stored procedure
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept(IN dept_name VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
  SELECT employee_id, name, salary
  FROM Employees
  WHERE department = dept_name
  ORDER BY salary DESC;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Execute procedure
CALL GetEmployeesByDept('Sales');

-- With output parameters
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount(
  IN dept_name VARCHAR(50),
  OUT emp_count INT
)
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO emp_count
  FROM Employees
  WHERE department = dept_name;
END;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a subquery?",
        a: "A subquery (also called an inner query or nested query) is a query embedded within another SQL query. It's enclosed in parentheses and can be used in SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or HAVING clauses. Subqueries can return a single value, a single row, multiple rows, or even a table. They're useful for complex filtering, calculations, and breaking down complex problems into simpler steps. The inner query executes first, and its result is used by the outer query.",
        example: `-- Subquery in WHERE clause
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees);

-- Subquery in FROM clause (derived table)
SELECT dept, avg_salary
FROM (
  SELECT department as dept, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY department
) AS dept_avg
WHERE avg_salary > 50000;

-- Subquery with IN
SELECT name
FROM Employees
WHERE department_id IN (
  SELECT department_id 
  FROM Departments 
  WHERE location = 'New York'
);`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a view?",
        a: "A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It doesn't store data physically but provides a logical representation of data from one or more tables. Views act as saved queries that can be queried like regular tables. Benefits include security (hide sensitive columns), simplification (present complex joins as simple tables), data abstraction, and consistency. Views are automatically updated when the underlying table data changes.",
        example: `-- Create view
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT employee_id, name, department, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Query the view like a table
SELECT * FROM EmployeeView WHERE department = 'Sales';

-- Complex view with joins
CREATE VIEW OrderDetails AS
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name, o.quantity
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

-- Update through view (if updatable)
UPDATE EmployeeView SET salary = 60000 WHERE employee_id = 101;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a cross join and an inner join?",
        a: "CROSS JOIN (Cartesian Product): Combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table. If Table A has 10 rows and Table B has 5 rows, the result will have 50 rows (10 × 5). No join condition is specified. Rarely used in practice but useful for generating combinations. \n\nINNER JOIN: Returns only rows where there's a match based on the join condition. It filters the cartesian product to show only related records. Most commonly used join type for retrieving related data from multiple tables.",
        example: `-- CROSS JOIN - All combinations (Cartesian product)
SELECT Products.name, Colors.color_name
FROM Products
CROSS JOIN Colors;
-- If 10 products × 5 colors = 50 rows

-- INNER JOIN - Only matching rows
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.order_id
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
-- Only customers who have orders

-- CROSS JOIN is equivalent to:
SELECT * FROM TableA, TableB;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the purpose of the COMMIT statement?",
        a: "The COMMIT statement permanently saves all changes made during the current transaction to the database. Once committed, the changes become visible to other users and cannot be undone with ROLLBACK. It marks the successful completion of a transaction, releases locks held during the transaction, and ensures durability - the changes will survive system failures. COMMIT is essential for finalizing multi-step operations and maintaining data consistency.",
        example: `-- Transaction with COMMIT
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Accounts (account_id, balance) VALUES (101, 1000);
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 101;
INSERT INTO Transactions (account_id, amount) VALUES (101, -100);

-- All operations successful, save permanently
COMMIT;

-- Auto-commit mode (each statement commits automatically)
SET autocommit = 1;
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (1, 'John');  -- Automatically committed`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the purpose of the ROLLBACK statement?",
        a: "The ROLLBACK statement undoes all changes made during the current transaction, reverting the database to its state before the transaction began. It's used when an error occurs or when you need to cancel a transaction. ROLLBACK releases all locks and ensures that no partial changes are saved, maintaining data integrity. It's crucial for error handling and ensuring transactions follow the 'all or nothing' principle of atomicity.",
        example: `-- Transaction with error handling
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Check if balance is sufficient
IF (SELECT balance FROM Accounts WHERE account_id = 1) < 0 THEN
  ROLLBACK;  -- Undo the withdrawal
  SELECT 'Insufficient funds' AS message;
ELSE
  UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

END IF;

-- Explicit rollback on error
START TRANSACTION;
-- operations...
-- Error occurred!
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo everything`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the purpose of the NULL value in SQL?",
        a: "NULL represents the absence of a value or an unknown value in SQL. It's distinctly different from zero (0), empty string (''), or false. NULL means 'no data' or 'value not applicable'. You cannot use regular comparison operators (=, !=) with NULL; instead, you must use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. NULL values are ignored in aggregate functions (except COUNT(*)), and any arithmetic operation with NULL returns NULL. Understanding NULL handling is crucial for data integrity.",
        example: `-- Checking for NULL (correct way)
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE phone IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;

-- This won't work (incorrect)
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE phone = NULL;  -- Always false!

-- NULL in operations
SELECT 10 + NULL;        -- Returns NULL
SELECT NULL = NULL;      -- Returns NULL (not true!)

-- COALESCE to handle NULL
SELECT name, COALESCE(phone, 'Not Provided') as phone
FROM Employees;

-- NULL in aggregate functions
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;  -- Ignores NULL salaries`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between a view and a materialized view?",
        a: "Regular View: A virtual table with no physical data storage. It executes the underlying query every time it's accessed, always showing current data. Fast to create/update but can be slow to query if the underlying query is complex. \n\nMaterialized View: A physical copy of the query result stored on disk. The data is pre-computed and cached, making queries very fast. However, the data can become stale and needs to be refreshed periodically (manually or scheduled). It trades data freshness for query performance. Use materialized views for complex, resource-intensive queries on data that doesn't change frequently.",
        example: `-- Regular View (no physical storage)
CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE status = 'active';
-- Query executes every time you SELECT from this view

-- Materialized View (PostgreSQL syntax)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW SalesSummary AS
SELECT 
  product_id, 
  SUM(quantity) as total_sold,
  AVG(price) as avg_price

SELECT * FROM SalesSummary;

-- Refresh when data changes
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW SalesSummary;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is a correlated subquery?",
        a: "A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. Unlike regular subqueries that execute once, a correlated subquery executes once for EACH row processed by the outer query. The inner query depends on the outer query for its values. While powerful for complex filtering, correlated subqueries can be slower than joins for large datasets because they run repeatedly. They're useful when you need row-by-row comparison with aggregated or filtered data.",
        example: `-- Find employees earning more than their department average
SELECT name, salary, department
FROM Employees e1
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM Employees e2
  WHERE e2.department = e1.department  -- References outer query
);

-- Find products with above-average prices in their category
SELECT product_name, price, category
FROM Products p1
WHERE price > (
  SELECT AVG(price)
  FROM Products p2
  WHERE p2.category = p1.category  -- Correlated reference
);

-- Find customers with more than 3 orders
SELECT customer_name
FROM Customers c
WHERE (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id  -- Correlated
) > 3;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the purpose of the DISTINCT keyword?",
        a: "The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the query result set, returning only unique values. It works on the entire row (all selected columns) or specific columns. DISTINCT is useful when you want to see unique values, such as unique customer names, distinct product categories, or unique email addresses. Note that DISTINCT can slow down queries on large datasets as it requires sorting or hashing to identify duplicates. It's often used in data analysis and reporting.",
        example: `-- Get unique departments
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM Employees;
-- Returns: Sales, Marketing, IT (no duplicates)

-- DISTINCT on multiple columns
SELECT DISTINCT department, job_title FROM Employees;
-- Returns unique combinations

-- Count unique values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers
FROM Orders;

-- Without DISTINCT (shows duplicates)
SELECT department FROM Employees;
-- Returns: Sales, Sales, Marketing, IT, Sales...

-- DISTINCT with other clauses
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM Customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
ORDER BY city;`,
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between the IN and EXISTS operators?",
        a: "IN Operator: Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery result. It evaluates the subquery completely first, then checks membership. Better for small result sets. Returns the full result set from the subquery. \n\nEXISTS Operator: Checks for the existence of rows returned by a subquery. Returns true as soon as it finds the first matching row (short-circuits). Generally faster for large datasets because it stops at the first match. Used with correlated subqueries. \n\nRule of thumb: Use EXISTS for large datasets and correlated subqueries; use IN for small, static lists.",
        example: `-- IN - checks if value is in the list
SELECT name FROM Employees
WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);

-- IN with subquery (evaluates subquery fully)
SELECT name FROM Employees
WHERE department_id IN (
  SELECT department_id FROM Departments WHERE location = 'NYC'
);

-- EXISTS - checks if any rows exist (stops at first match)
SELECT name FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Orders o
  WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id

        a: "A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes (fires) in response to specific events on a table or view. Triggers are defined for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations and can execute BEFORE or AFTER the event. They're commonly used for: enforcing complex business rules, maintaining audit trails, enforcing referential integrity, automatically updating derived columns, and logging changes. Triggers help maintain data consistency and automate database tasks without application-level code.",

        a: "Unique Constraint: A logical constraint that enforces uniqueness at the table level. It's part of the table definition and clearly expresses business rules. When you create a unique constraint, the database automatically creates a unique index to enforce it. Prevents duplicate values and can be referenced by foreign keys. \n\nUnique Index: A physical database structure that enforces uniqueness and improves query performance. Can exist independently of constraints. Primarily for performance optimization but also prevents duplicates. \n\nIn practice, they're very similar - creating a unique constraint usually creates a unique index behind the scenes. The main difference is conceptual: constraints express business rules, indexes optimize performance.",

        q: "What is the purpose of the TOP or LIMIT clause?",
        a: "The TOP (SQL Server) or LIMIT (MySQL, PostgreSQL) clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query. It's essential for pagination, getting top/bottom N results, sampling data, and improving performance by limiting result sets. Often combined with ORDER BY to get the highest/lowest values (top salaries, most recent orders, etc.). LIMIT also supports OFFSET for pagination, allowing you to skip rows and retrieve the next batch.",
        example: `-- MySQL LIMIT - Get first 10 rows
SELECT * FROM Employees

LIMIT 10;

-- Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY product_id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;  -- Skip first 20, get next 10 (page 3)

        a: "UNION: Combines result sets from multiple SELECT statements VERTICALLY (stacking rows). All SELECT statements must have the same number of columns with compatible data types. Creates a single result set with more rows. Used to combine similar data from different sources. \n\nJOIN: Combines data from multiple tables HORIZONTALLY (adding columns). Matches rows based on related columns. Creates a wider result set with columns from multiple tables. Used to retrieve related data across tables. \n\nThink of it as: UNION adds more rows, JOIN adds more columns.",

It consolidates data from multiple operational sources (databases, CRM, ERP systems) into a single, consistent format. Unlike transactional databases (OLTP) optimized for frequent updates, data warehouses (OLAP) are optimized for complex queries and analysis. They store historical data, support decision-making, enable trend analysis, and use star/snowflake schemas. Data is ETL'd (Extracted, Transformed, Loaded) from source systems into the warehouse.",

A table can have multiple candidate keys - all columns that satisfy uniqueness and minimal properties. Each candidate key is a potential choice for the primary key. \n\nPrimary Key: The chosen candidate key that actually serves as the main unique identifier for the table. A table has only ONE primary key, selected from the available candidate keys. It cannot contain NULL values and is often used in foreign key relationships. \n\nExample: In a Users table, email, username, and SSN might all be candidate keys, but you choose user_id as the primary key.",

You can grant permissions on different levels: entire database, specific tables, specific columns, or stored procedures. Common privileges include SELECT (read), INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (modify), CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and EXECUTE. GRANT helps implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the access they need for their job functions.",

        q: "What is a correlated update?",
        a: "A correlated update is an UPDATE statement that uses a subquery referencing the same table being updated. The subquery executes once for each row being updated, using values from the current row to determine the new value. It's useful for updating rows based on calculations or comparisons with other rows in the same table. While powerful, correlated updates can be slow on large tables because the subquery runs for every row. Common use cases include updating running totals, rankings, or values based on related rows.",
        example: `-- Update salary based on department average
UPDATE Employees e1

        a: "The CASE statement is SQL's conditional expression, similar to if-else in programming. It allows you to implement conditional logic directly in queries to return different values based on conditions. There are two forms: Simple CASE (compares an expression to values) and Searched CASE (evaluates boolean conditions). CASE is incredibly versatile - use it in SELECT for conditional columns, in WHERE for complex filtering, in ORDER BY for custom sorting, and in UPDATE for conditional updates. It makes queries more powerful and reduces the need for multiple queries.",

COALESCE evaluates arguments left to right and returns the first non-NULL value it encounters. If all arguments are NULL, it returns NULL. It's cleaner and more flexible than nested IFNULL or ISNULL functions. Common uses include: displaying default values for missing data, combining multiple nullable columns, ensuring a non-NULL result, and implementing fallback values in reports.",
        example: `-- Basic usage - return first non-NULL

It returns only one copy of the common columns. While convenient, it's risky because adding a new column with the same name in both tables can break the join unexpectedly. Rarely used in production due to lack of explicit control. \n\nINNER JOIN: Explicitly specifies the join condition using ON or USING clause. You have full control over which columns to match. More verbose but safer and clearer. This is the standard and recommended approach for joining tables as it's explicit, maintainable, and less prone to unexpected behavior.",
        example: `-- NATURAL JOIN - automatic based on column names

It maintains referential integrity by preventing orphaned records. When you delete a parent record, all related child records are automatically removed without manual intervention. This is powerful but dangerous - use it carefully as it can delete large amounts of data. Alternatives include SET NULL (set foreign key to NULL) or RESTRICT (prevent deletion if child records exist). CASCADE DELETE is useful for hierarchical data where child records are meaningless without their parent.",

        a: "An alias is a temporary name given to a table or column in a SQL query using the AS keyword (which is optional). Aliases make queries more readable, especially with long table/column names, and are essential when using joins, self-joins, or when you need to distinguish between multiple instances of the same table. Column aliases appear in the result set headers. Table aliases are required in self-joins and convenient in complex joins. Aliases exist only for the duration of the query. They're a fundamental SQL feature that improves code readability and maintainability.",
        example: `-- Column alias - rename columns in result
SELECT 
  employee_id AS id,
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM Employees;
-- Result columns: id, full_name, annual_salary

-- Table alias - shorter names for tables
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Departments AS d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
-- 'AS' keyword is optional:
-- FROM Employees e is same as FROM Employees AS e

-- Required for self-joins
SELECT 
  e1.name AS employee,
  e2.name AS manager
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
-- Without aliases e1 and e2, can't distinguish them

-- Alias in WHERE clause (must use original name or derived table)
SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary * 12 > 60000;  -- Can't use annual_salary here in WHERE

-- But can use in ORDER BY and HAVING
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING avg_sal > 50000  -- Can use alias here
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;  -- And here

-- Alias for complex expressions
SELECT 
  product_name,
  price,
  quantity,
  price * quantity AS total_value,
  CASE 
    WHEN price * quantity > 1000 THEN 'High Value'
    ELSE 'Standard'
  END AS value_category
FROM Products;`,
      },

        q: "Why are SQL functions used?",
        a: "SQL functions are pre-built operations that perform specific tasks and return values. They're essential for data manipulation, transformation, and analysis directly within queries. Main categories include: \n\n• Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) - perform calculations on groups of rows \n• String Functions (CONCAT, SUBSTRING, UPPER, LOWER, TRIM) - manipulate text data \n• Date/Time Functions (NOW, DATE_FORMAT, DATEDIFF, DATE_ADD) - handle temporal data \n• Numeric Functions (ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR, ABS, POWER) - mathematical operations \n• Conversion Functions (CAST, CONVERT) - change data types \n• Conditional Functions (CASE, IF, COALESCE, NULLIF) - implement logic \n\nFunctions eliminate the need for application-level processing, improve performance by processing data at the database level, ensure consistency, and make queries more powerful and concise.",
        example: `-- Aggregate Functions - calculations on groups
SELECT 
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
  MAX(salary) AS max_salary,
  SUM(salary) AS total_payroll
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department;

-- String Functions - text manipulation
SELECT 
  UPPER(name) AS name_upper,
  LOWER(email) AS email_lower,
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  SUBSTRING(phone, 1, 3) AS area_code,
  LENGTH(description) AS desc_length,
  TRIM(address) AS clean_address
FROM Users;

-- Date/Time Functions - temporal operations
SELECT 
  order_date,
  NOW() AS current_time,
  DATEDIFF(NOW(), order_date) AS days_since_order,
  DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS formatted_date,
  YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
  MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
  DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) AS due_date
FROM Orders;

-- Numeric Functions - math operations
SELECT 
  price,
  ROUND(price, 2) AS rounded_price,
  CEIL(price) AS ceiling,
  FLOOR(price) AS floor,
  ABS(profit) AS absolute_profit,
  POWER(quantity, 2) AS quantity_squared,
  SQRT(area) AS side_length
FROM Products;

-- Conversion Functions - type changes
SELECT 
  CAST(price AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS decimal_price,
  CONVERT(order_date, CHAR) AS date_string,
  CAST('123' AS UNSIGNED) AS number_from_string
FROM Orders;

-- Conditional Functions - logic in queries
SELECT 
  name,
  salary,
  CASE 
    WHEN salary > 80000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS salary_grade,
  COALESCE(bonus, 0) AS bonus_with_default,
  IF(status = 'active', 'Yes', 'No') AS is_active
